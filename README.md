ðŸ“¦ Project: Node.js Multithreading with Worker Threads
This project is a REST API built with Express.js that demonstrates how to use Node.js Worker Threads to parallelize heavy CPU tasks, improving application performance without blocking the main thread.

âœ¨ Main Features
/primes â†’ Calculates all prime numbers between 1 and 50,000 using 4 parallel workers.

/primes/first-n?n=50 â†’ Returns the first N prime numbers (executed on the main thread, no workers).

Logging middleware â†’ Automatically measures the processing time of each request.

Separation of concerns â†’ Code organized into controllers, services, routes, and workers.

Modern ECMAScript Modules (ESM) â†’ Project configured with "type": "module".

ðŸŽ¯ What you learn with this project
How to use Worker Threads in Node.js to run CPU-intensive tasks in parallel.

When to use workers (for CPU-bound tasks) and when not to (for I/O-bound tasks).
